# BASIC GIT COMMANDS
Git commands are a distributed version control system for tracking changes in any set of files. They were originally designed for coordinating work among programmers who were operating source codes during software development.

## git init
git init is one way to start a new project with Git. To start a repository, use either git init.

## git add
The git add selects that file, and moves it to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit. You can select all files, a directory, specific files, or even specific parts of a file for staging and commit.

## git commit
The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.

## git config
The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level. These configuration levels correspond to . gitconfig text files.

## git merge
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

## git status
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

## git branch
The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. 

## git checkout
The git checkout refers to the action of swaping between different repository branches/files/commits. It helps in switching between different branches that have been created by git branch.

## git remote
In Git, the term remote is concerned with the remote repository. It is a shared repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. A remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like an internal server, GitHub, Subversion, and more.

## git clone
The git clone is a command-line utility which is used to make a local copy of a remote repository. It accesses the repository through a remote URL.

## git push
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.

## git pull
The git pull is a Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. It is one of the four commands that prompts network interaction by Git. By default, git pull does two things. 

## git log
Git log is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository. Multiple options can be used with a git log to make history more specific. Generally, the git log is a record of commits.
